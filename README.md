# Cocaine
Are [steroids](https://github.com/subspecs/Steroids) not doing it for you anymore?<br>
Need that 'kick' in the mornings to get you through the day?

### Look no further because we have the solution for you!

### Meet <ins>**Cocaine**</ins>!
A multi-platform C library that can be used to accelerate <ins>large</ins> workloads/big data/<ins>anything really</ins> with the power of a GPU with ease. <br>
And you know what's the best part of it? You can even let grandma do a line.

### That's right!
The library uses ONLY the default OpenGL 4.3 or Open GL ES 3.1 features with no extensions.<br>
Meaning this thing works on toasters/solitaire/potato/trashcan machines that were made from 2010* and up.
